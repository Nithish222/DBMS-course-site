                <p><br> Simple Queries in DBMS <br>
                    "When working with a Database Management System, or DBMS, one of the fundamental skills is writing and understanding simple queries. In this video, let's explore basic query types and operations you can perform in a DBMS."<br>
                    "At its core, a database query is a request for data or information from a database. The most common type of query is the SQL (Structured Query Language) query. SQL is used to communicate with relational databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data."<br>
                    "Let's start with the most basic query: the SELECT statement. This statement retrieves data from a database. You can use it to fetch specific columns or all columns from a table. For example, if you want to get the names and ages of all employees from an 'Employees' table, you would write: SELECT name, age FROM Employees."<br>
                    "Another essential query is the WHERE clause, used to filter data based on specific conditions. If you want to retrieve employees older than 30, you could write: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE age > 30."<br>
                    "Sorting data is another common operation in a DBMS. You can use the ORDER BY clause to sort results in ascending or descending order. For instance, if you want to list employees by age from youngest to oldest, you would write: SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY age ASC."<br>
                    "Joins are fundamental for working with multiple tables. A JOIN query connects related data from different tables based on a common field. For example, if you have 'Employees' and 'Departments' tables with a common 'department_id' field, you could join them with: SELECT * FROM Employees INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.department_id = Departments.department_id."<br>
                    "Aggregation queries are useful for summarizing data. Functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX allow you to perform calculations on data. If you want to count the total number of employees, you could use: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees."<br>
                    "Subqueries and nested queries add another layer of complexity, allowing you to use a query within a query. This technique is helpful for more complex operations, such as finding employees with salaries above the average salary: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees)."<br>
                    "In summary, simple queries in DBMS form the foundation for interacting with databases. From SELECT statements to WHERE clauses, ORDER BY, JOINs, aggregation functions, and subqueries, mastering these basic operations is key to working with relational databases."<br>
