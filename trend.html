                <p><br> Trends in DBMS <br>
                    "One significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based DBMS. As more organizations move to the cloud, DBMS solutions are following suit, offering greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. This trend aligns with the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS), enabling businesses to access databases from anywhere." <br>
                    "Another trend is the rise of NoSQL databases. Traditional relational DBMS is increasingly complemented by NoSQL systems, which are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are gaining popularity in industries like social media, e-commerce, and big data analytics due to their ability to scale horizontally and manage diverse data types."<br>
                    "Automation and AI integration are also making waves in the DBMS landscape. Automation tools streamline database management tasks, reducing manual efforts and human errors. Meanwhile, AI and machine learning are enhancing DBMS capabilities, enabling predictive analytics and intelligent data insights."<br>
                    "With the exponential growth of data, security is a top priority in DBMS. The trend is toward enhanced security features, such as encryption, multi-factor authentication, and advanced access controls. These measures help protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations."<br>
                    "Edge computing is another emerging trend in DBMS. As more devices generate data at the edge of the network, DBMS solutions are adapting to process and analyze this data closer to its source. This trend reduces latency and supports real-time decision-making in applications like IoT and autonomous systems."<br>
                    "The trend towards open-source DBMS is also notable. Open-source databases are becoming more sophisticated, offering robust features and community support. This trend allows businesses to leverage powerful DBMS solutions without the high costs associated with proprietary software."<br>
                    "In summary, trends in DBMS reflect a dynamic landscape, driven by technological advancements and evolving business needs. From cloud-based solutions to NoSQL, automation, AI, security, edge computing, and open-source development, DBMS is set to play a critical role in the future of data management."<br>
